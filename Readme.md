# Sneak peek: Awesome books

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Remember to start each week with setting working agreements with your partner to improve your collaboration and to avoid conflict. [You can find the lesson here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/orientation/working-agreements-for-successful-pair-programming.md). Bookmark it so you can use it at the start of each week. If you are experiencing difficulties with your partner, reach out to Student Success right away so we can help you. It's important that you have a good collaboration that results in learning. We always try to speak to all parties involved to resolve the conflict. In some cases, we will re-pair you with a new student (this is only possible in the beginning of the week).* 

## Description

"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.
By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that your website will be more interactive.
You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

### What is a medium-fidelity wireframe?

Medium-fidelity wireframes present how your website's elements should be arranged, but they skip detailed information about aesthetics (e.g., colors, images).
They can assist with communicating to teams how aesthetic features can support essential functionalities. Please read [Low Fidelity Wireframes vs High Fidelity Wireframes](https://mentormate.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/) to fully understand the difference between low-, medium-, and high-fidelity wireframes.

### Projects list

You will be building your "Awesome books" website for the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities. In all of the projects, you will be working collaboratively by using pair-programming.


- [Project 1: Manage books collection (plain JS with objects).](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/books/m1_plain_js_objects_v1_1.md)
- [Project 2: Manage books collection (plain JS with classes) and add basic CSS.
